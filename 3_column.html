        First Idea: Robots as machines to make things
        </h2>
        <h3> Robots have difficult with simple jobs like walking on 2 legs or patting a dog </h3>
        <h3> Robots can use machine learning to keep practising and lower error rates </h3>

          Second Idea: Robots as automated cars
          </h2>
          <h3> Cars only need to speed up or slow down and turn left or turn right </h3>
          <h3> However, they also need proximity sensors and computer vision algorithms </h3>

            Third Idea: Robots as lethal autonomous weapons
            </h2>
            <h3> Asimov's laws say Robots must not harm people </h3>
            <h3> South Korea has an automatic sentry </h3>
            <p class="box"> Another example of a system with semiautonomous capabilities is Samsung’s SGR-A1, a military border sentry robot in development for deployment on the border between North and South Korea. Essentially an unarmed guard tower, the system is designed to assist border guards by scanning the area for those who might try to cross the border.
